Grammar Autocorrected ASR

Transcribing audio is a difficult task, and it becomes even harder when the audio is noisy or the speaker's first language is not English. Most approaches to transcription focus on being faithful to the original audio, but our aim is to use auto-correction to produce grammatically correct transcriptions.

We are working with audio/speech and text data. Speech audio, not-so-grammatically-correct, is input to our solution and it outputs in text modality, transcription auto-corrected for grammar, with an auxiliary text output, faithful to the input speech.

For extracting sentences from news article files we used the script sentenceextractionfiles.ipynb and for adding noise we used addnoise2text.ipynb.
